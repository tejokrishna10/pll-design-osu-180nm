1.**INTRODUCTION TO ON-CHIP CLOCK MULTIPLIER:**

The repository contains simulation files and other relevant files for on-chip clock multiplier using PLL(Fclock-in:5MHZ-12MHz ;Fclock-out:40MHz-100MHz at 1.8V)IP.
The goal is to design on-chip clock multiplier using OSU-180nm technology node.The on-chip clock multiplier is present in almost all synchronous processors.
